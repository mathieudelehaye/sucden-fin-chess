/**
 * @class ITransport
 * @brief Abstract interface for all transport mechanisms.

 * This interface defines the communication contract between the server
 * and any transport implementation (TCP, IPC,  etc.). Concrete transport
 * classes must implement send(), start(), and close(). A transport delivers
 * raw text messages to the upper networking layer and sends serialized responses.
 *
 * This abstraction allows the server to switch between transport implementations
 * without modifying controllers or model logic (Strategy pattern).
